‚úÖ**Project Summary**

The project involves creating a proof-of-concept application using Angular and .Net 6 Web API to determine if software development productivity improves using the Angular framework. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations on courses stored in a SQL Server database. The back end is developed using a .Net 7 API, and the front end is developed using Angular. Key features include a Course Listing page, Edit Course page, and Add Course page, all accessible via Angular routing. The application aims to showcase the benefits of using Angular for front-end development and its integration with a .Net back end.

‚úÖ**ETL Process**

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process involves extracting data from the SQL Server database, transforming it into a format suitable for the front end, and loading it into the Angular application for display. This process ensures that users can interact with the data seamlessly.
